Requirements
============

Chipmunk Physics (v6.1.4):
    requires CMake (>= 2.6)

SDL (v1.12.15)

Building on Unices
==================

On Ubuntu, CMake and SDL can come from repositories:
    sudo apt-get install cmake libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev

Chipmunk should be built from source.

Building on Windows
===================

I've been using MinGW (make, gcc, etc) for Windows development. Visual Studio
will probably also work but I don't know how yet.

CMake should be installed from their website.

MinGW:
    google, download, install. You don't need MSYS.
    you might need to add C:\MinGW\bin to your system path and reboot.

Chipmunk Physics (v6.1.4):
    download source
    use CMake (Ensure to use MinGW makefiles)
    Copy src\libchipmunk.dll and src\libchipmunk.a to c:\minGW\lib
    Copy include\* to c:\MinGW\include

SDL (v1.12.15):
    Easiest options is to download development libraries
    Copy include\* to c:\mingw\include
    Copy lib\* to c:\mingw\lib
    Copy bin\* to c:\mingw\bin
    see lazyfoo.net if you get stuck
